I’m Saurabh Chauhan, a JavaScript Full Stack Developer and Product Engineer at Travelopia. Over the past years, I’ve built scalable web applications for travel reservation systems—focusing on performance, reliability, and user experience. Today, I’m taking that experience into a new chapter: building SchoolArk.

## Why SchoolArk

SchoolArk is my mission to make schooling easy, accessible, and transparent for millions of students, parents, and institutions. It brings together verified listings and discovery for schools, teachers, and education jobs—backed by an SEO‑first, high‑performance experience. The vision is simple: reduce the friction in how families and educators find each other and make better decisions.

## What I’m building first

- Rich listings and search for schools, teachers, and jobs
- Comparison tools to evaluate schools side‑by‑side
- Role‑based dashboards for students, teachers, and institutions
- Content for organic growth and community trust

On the horizon: HotsPot (local events and nearby utilities) and BudAi—an AI‑driven career counselling assistant to help students navigate choices with confidence.

## What I bring to the table

From rebuilding legacy tools to crafting scalable APIs and front‑ends, my background spans React, Next.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL/Prisma, testing, and AWS infrastructure. That product‑engineering mindset—ship fast, measure, and iterate—guides how I’m building SchoolArk from day one.

## The road ahead

I’m starting small, validating with users, and expanding features based on real‑world feedback. If you’re a school, educator, parent, or collaborator interested in this space, I’d love to connect.

Thanks for being part of this journey—more updates soon.
