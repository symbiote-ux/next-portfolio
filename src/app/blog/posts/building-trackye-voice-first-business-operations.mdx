## The Problem Trackye Solves

Indian service businesses were drowning in fragmented tools. Founders switched between 5-7 different apps daily—Trello for tasks, QuickBooks for finances, WhatsApp for clients, Excel for HR. The friction was killing productivity.

I built something radical: a platform where you could literally "talk to your business." Speak in Hindi, English, or Hinglish, and the system would understand, categorize, and execute.

## Tech Stack That Scales

Building a voice-AI platform for Indian businesses required balancing cutting-edge features with reliability, cost, and local market realities.

**Next.js 15 + Prisma + PostgreSQL**: Server actions pattern gave me RPC-like function calls without GraphQL complexity. Automatic code splitting and edge runtime optimization were crucial for voice processing.

**OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: Cost-effective at $0.15/1M tokens, but powerful enough for Indian language processing. Vision capabilities enabled OCR for invoice scanning.

## The Voice Processing Pipeline

Voice processing needed to be accurate for business-critical operations, but cheap enough to scale.

```javascript
// Voice processing pipeline
Voice/Audio → Whisper → Text → GPT-4 → Structured Data → Database

// Cost optimization: GPT-4o-mini at $0.15/1M tokens
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: process.env.OPENAI_MODEL || 'gpt-4o-mini',
  temperature: 0.1, // Low creativity = higher accuracy
  max_tokens: 500,  // Strict limits prevent cost overruns
});
```

**Key Optimization**: Parallelized AI calls reduced processing from 4.2s to 1.8s, dropping costs 35% while improving user completion rates from 68% to 89%.

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

Indian businesses range from solopreneurs to 50-person agencies. Database-level tenant isolation with smart query optimization:

```sql
-- Tenant-aware queries with automatic filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_assigned_status ON tasks(assigned_to, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_finances_date_category ON finances(transaction_date, category);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_permissions ON users USING GIN(permissions);
```

**Performance Win**: Single query aggregation using Prisma's groupBy reduced database load by 60% on analytics endpoints.

## Performance Battles Won

### Dashboard Query Explosions
**Before**: 12+ separate queries, 3.8s load time, 85 concurrent users
**After**: Single optimized query, 1.2s load time, 320 concurrent users

### WhatsApp Message Processing
**Before**: 4.1s processing time, 12% webhook timeouts
**After**: 0.3s perceived time, 0.1% timeouts, 94% user satisfaction

### Permission System
Cached permissions in JWT payloads: 50ms database calls → instant reads.

## Real Metrics That Matter

**System Performance**:
- P95 latency under 500ms for all endpoints
- 500 concurrent voice processing sessions
- 99.9% uptime across Indian time zones
- $0.02 per voice task processed

**User Experience**:
- Voice to task creation: 1.8 seconds
- Dashboard load: Sub-second with 10k+ records
- Mobile performance: 85% faster than competitors on 3G

## Lessons Learned: Building for Indian Businesses

**Language Matters**: Hindi and Hinglish processing required custom AI fine-tuning.

**Network Reality**: Everything optimized for poor connectivity and variable speeds.

**Regulatory Compliance**: GST calculations and Indian workflows built-in from day one.

**Cost Sensitivity**: Every decision considers the ₹500/user/month pricing model.

## The Tradeoffs That Made It Real

- **AI Cost vs Accuracy**: GPT-4o-mini costs 1/10th of GPT-4 but requires more prompt engineering
- **Database Complexity vs Speed**: Complex indexed queries are harder to debug but 5x faster
- **Multi-tenancy Overhead**: 20% performance overhead for 80% cost savings
- **Real-time vs Performance**: Sacrificed some real-time features for better perceived performance

Trackye transformed how Indian businesses operate—voice-first, efficient, and built for real-world constraints.
