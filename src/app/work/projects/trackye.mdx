# Trackye

**Tagline:** "Talk to your business."

**Subtitle:** All-in-one operations platform for service businesses (India)

---

## 2. Problem & Market Opportunity

### Problem:

Service businesses (agencies, consultancies, schools) are juggling multiple fragmented tools: WhatsApp groups, spreadsheets, paper logs, separate apps.

**Manual data entry, lack of automation → wasted time & errors.**

Many tools miss the voice-input requirement for bilingual teams in India (Hindi + English).

### Market Opportunity:

Small service businesses in India (1-20 employees) are underserved by enterprise tools.

**Huge demand for affordable, easy-to-use SaaS that fits local language + local workflows.**

---

## 3. Solution

Trackye offers:

**A unified web app where teams can manage tasks, employees, clients, expenses, all in one place.**

**Voice-to-text input in Hindi & English:** speak to add tasks, expenses, clients.

**Alerts via in-app, WhatsApp, email so nothing slips through.**

**Built specifically for Indian service-business workflows (templates for agencies, salons, schools).**

**Transparent pricing (₹500/user/month) making it accessible for small teams.**
